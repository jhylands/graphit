# Command line graphs

Based on the perl script [here](http://bloodgate.com/perl/graph/manual/overview.html)

1. To use change the location in the docker-compose file to where you have checked out this repository.
2. Run the make.sh file, this will create the named pipes and start the docker image.
3. Either use graph.sh passing the graph as input or do some work to get it in your bin so it can be called more generally.
